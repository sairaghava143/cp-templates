# Hello!
This is a collection of snippets that I regularly use while participating in competitive programming contests / solving competitive programming problems.
The snipptets are in `.sublime-snippet` format because I use Sublime Text most of the time.
This is just a set of basic algorithms, and there are amazing libraries out there such as [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl/). The main motivation for this library is that it helps me keep my snippets organised and I can clone them quickly if I have to switch my OS for some reason.
Still, I hope you find this helpful. Any feedback/suggestions are welcome!
